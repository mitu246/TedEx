# Topic Modeling and Analysis:
TedEx Data is being downloaded from Kaggle which contains the information about 2467 ted talks arranged between 2007 and 2014. The dataset contains complete "Transcript" of the talk, "Number of Comments" it grossed on the discussion forums, "Number of Views", and the information about the Author and Topic of each talk.

Task 1: Motivation for this project is to find the general topics (Genres) for different type of talks such that we can cluster 2467 talks in a few topics, e.g if we have 6 talks where the theme was "Personal Growth and Motivation", all of them should be clustered in the topic "Personal Growth and Motivation". This is an unsupervised problem where we have the transcript for 2467 talks and we have to generate let's say 10-15 topics that represent all these 2467 talks.

Task 2: With the topics identified it would be interesting to know that what kind of topics gross most comments on discussion forums and what kind of talk gets viewed the most. Also, we are given the date the Talk was arranged, so we can also learn how the trend in the popularity of each topic has changed over the years. e.g maybe in 2007 talks related to "Science and Innovation" were famous while in 2016 the talks related to "Politics and Economic Issues" were famous.
